Welcome to Opscode's ChefConf Workshop for System Administrators!

This is the
[Chef Repository](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Repository)
for the system administrator focused workshop. It contains the
cookbooks, roles and data bags required to set up the initial system
used in the hands on exercises.

It also contains a .chef directory with a pregenerated user private
key, validation key and knife.rb. The purpose of these files will be
explained throughout the Workshop.
